# Data Analytics Portfolio

First of all, thank you for reading this.

I created this repository to showcase my data analytics projects and demonstrate my technical and analytical capabilities. The goal of this collection is to present practical examples of how I approach data problems, transform raw datasets, and extract meaningful insights using SQL, Python, and data visualization tools.

Inside this repository, you will find projects that cover the full data workflow, including:
- Data cleaning and preparation
- Database design and SQL querying
- Business-focused data analysis
- KPI and performance analysis
- Advanced SQL techniques
- Data visualization and reporting

Each project is designed to reflect real-world analytical scenarios and demonstrate both technical implementation and business thinking.

This repository represents my continuous learning journey in data analytics, and I actively expand it with new projects, techniques, and analytical approaches.

Thank you for taking the time to review my work.
